## ðŸ‘‹ About me
- Hi there! I am a data engineer professionally and hobbyist software engineer by heart who likes to learn new things and put it on a code (if possible).
- Currently interested in backend development, simple CLI stuff, and scientific computing (anything that are FOSS and not related to my professional work ðŸ˜‰).
- Still dreaming of creating my own FOSS computational physics software.
- Newbie to desktop ricing, still working on my personal [dotfiles](https://github.com/thomasoca/dotfiles).

## ðŸŒ± Technologies I used (or wanted to learn)
- python
- golang
- language for scientific computation (still deciding)
- godot & GDscript for making a simple games
